# WorstCalculator

This is a terrible math library implementation, which uses string operations to implement addition, multiplication, division and subtraction. This project was created for a competition.

It includes a WPF calculator app that uses the terrible math lib and a suite a unit tests that check the terrrible math library for accuracy. It takes about a quarter of an hour to run the tests, because the library is so terrible.
